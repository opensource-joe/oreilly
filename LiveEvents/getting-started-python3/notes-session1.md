# Getting started with Python 3 - Session 1
by Matt Harrison

- Example: Use Markov chain to make a text prediction
- Run py script in terminal in interactive mode $ python3 -i script.py
- Python looks for variable in four places - local namespace (inside function), enclosed namespace (nested function), global namespace, built-in namespace
- Namespace errors usually occur b/c of type or forgot to import something
- Random is part of standard library in Python, it allows for doing things randomly but need to import to access
- Docstring needs to be at top of py file, if not then it is a dangling string
