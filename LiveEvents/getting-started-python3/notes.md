# Getting started with Python 3
by Matt Harrison

## Session 1

- Example: Use [Markov chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain) to make a text prediction

- Run py script in terminal in interactive mode $ python3 -i script.py
- Python looks for variable in four places - local namespace (inside function), enclosed namespace (nested function), global namespace, built-in namespace
- In Python3 >>> help()

- Namespace errors usually occur b/c of type or forgot to import something
- Random is part of standard library in Python, it allows for doing things randomly but need to import to access
- Docstring needs to be at top of py file, if not then it is a dangling string
- Test driven development - write a test for the behavior you want, write the code, then test
- Regression test - add some functionality to code and make sure existing functionality doesn't break because of new code
- Python is multi-paradigmetic language, can use classes or imperative approach
- Unit and unit testing are often debated
- Over 400k external Python libraries, Python has standard libraries

## Session 2

- python3 -m file.idle - look for directory of files looking for idle.qy and execute it
- dir() - returns all properties and methods of the specified object, without the values. This function will return all the properties and methods, even built-in properties which are default for all object
- Test Driven Development (TDD)
- slice - can use index to get specific characters
